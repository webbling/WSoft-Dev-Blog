&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-progress--boss-attacks-meeting&quot;&gt;Current Progress + Boss Attacks Meeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left off on my last blog post talking about how we had very little boss attacks implemented/planned to be implemented. I had created a lot more simple designs that could be easily implemented. Obviously COVID-19 impacted our ability to turn this boss into what it could be. There’s also a lot of animation that has to be done with every boss attack so we were limited in what we were able to do moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the week after the March 22nd studio meeting, Gino, Thomas, Tolu, and I held a designers meeting. During this meeting we talked about how we don’t have a lot of time left to implement new things. Every attack we design requires a cetain amount of animation and at this point in time we had virtually no boss animations. In this meeting we discussed what we would be satisfied with as an end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of discussion we settled on 6 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wall attack that I prototyped&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throw sword/slam&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throw sword/slam w/ spikes&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An air lazer attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ground lazer attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A charging attack&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are a little similar. The overall goal of this meeting was to try to make as many attacks as possible while reusing as many animations as possible. A lot of these attacks start out the same, have different intermediate actions, and similar endings. We ended the meeting with the impression that the lazor attack could potentially not make it into the game because it requires the most assets from other pods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playtesting&quot;&gt;Playtesting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Gino got a few of the Boss attacks implemented they needed to be tested. This was my only Jira task for the remainder of this sprint. I spent time looping each attack that had been implemented so far. Theis was teh feedback that I had for Gino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boss doesn’t give any indication that it’s charging versus teleporting to it’s sword/slam&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boss charges too fast for the player to react&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing Reference bug breaks the Boss Attack - Scriptable Object generator&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wall Attack missing spikes&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boss teleport VFX happens when Io teleports&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without Boss health and Io health implemented in this Unity MVP scene, it was too difficult to dertermine if Io had a large enough window to damage the boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revisiting-an-old-design-concept-1-hour-30-min&quot;&gt;Revisiting an Old Design Concept (1 Hour 30 Min)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our March 8th meeting Gino shared that the project leads decided to have the player’s gameplay experience focused more on platforming than combat. This didn’t really impact my already comopleted prototypes, but it didn’t impact prototypes I had planned to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gino brought up my old design where the boss would summon a wall of projectiles with a small game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Boss_Attack_Sketch1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Old-Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flaws of this design were discussed in my first blog post, but Gino wanted to know if I could revisit this concept and make it work in our now platforming-centric game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent around an hour and a half turning this design into a concept that I could make a prototype around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-1&quot;&gt;Phase 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Wall_Prototype_Phase1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Phase1-Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a wall of projectiles I changed them to just solid crystal walls. I think the player should have the option to blink/teleprot through them since there is a finite amount of teleportation that could be done during this attack. The walls break right before the edge of the arena to prep the player for phase 2 of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-2&quot;&gt;Phase 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Wall_Prototype_Phase2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Phase2-Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twist is that there are now spikes at the side of the arena that will damage the player if pushed into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-3&quot;&gt;Phase 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Wall_Prototype_Phase3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Phase3-Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 3 is more of the same, but more difficult. Spikes come up from the ground in a wave, forcing the player to stay on the moving walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;obtaining-boss-sprite-30-min&quot;&gt;Obtaining Boss Sprite (30 Min)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really didn’t like how in my last prototype the boss was just a black box. I know prototypes are suppossed to be quick implementations and not necessarily meant to look good, but I feel better when things I make are nice to look at. That’s why I wanted to put the Bosses’ sprite in my next prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the only realatively finished sprite I could find of the boss was on Discord with no transparent pixels preserved (the part of the PNG that was suppossed to be transparent was not a white and gray checkerboard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Old_Crystal_Boss.png&quot; alt=&quot;Not-Transparent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I foolishly started erasing these pixels using Krita and my drawing tablet for 20 minutes and hardly accomplished anything. Then I realized that Krita can use the Fill Tool to erase as well. After altering the Threshold of the Fill Tool, I was able to quickly make the background of the sprite transparent again, allowing it to be used in my Unity prototype scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Crystal_Boss.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transparent&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I DID NOT CREATE THIS BOSS, I JUST GAVE IT A TRANSPARENT BACKGROUND TO USE IN PROTOTYPES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crystal-wall-protoype-6-hours&quot;&gt;Crystal Wall Protoype (6 hours)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my 2nd DOTween prototype so I was more comfortable going into this script, but I still ran into some issues that I will bring up when discussing each phase. I also took some time to make sure my code was a lot cleaner in this protoype script than my previous. In my previous prototype I had a script for each phase and a lot of duplicating code. In this script I had 3 bool variables and 3 functions that had the code for each phase’s action. The value of the bool variables determined what actions were executed in the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-1-1&quot;&gt;Phase 1&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/crystal-wall-phase1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;phase1-prototype&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phase took WAY longer than I was expecting it to. It didn’t take too long to create all the crystal walls using primitive Unity objects, but I spent a lot of time on moving the walls. I wanted my walls to move at constant speed, but no matter what Ease I set for the DOMove or DOPath (both DOTween methods I tried) the walls would move faster at the beginning of their Tween Sequance and slow down at the end. I tried many different Eases, but even the Linear Ease maintained the same pattern of speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent too much time trying to make DOTween move at a constant speed (which may not even be possible). What I ended up doing was adding a Ridigbody to my Wall containers and set their velocity after setting them to be active game objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-2-1&quot;&gt;Phase 2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/crystal-wall-phase2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;phase2-prototype&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was too hard to implement. I just have a container that holds 9 spikes that moves to a certain Transform component with DOMove().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-3-1&quot;&gt;Phase 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/crystal-wall-phase3.gif&quot; alt=&quot;phase3-prototype&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I googled ways to move individual game objects in a wave, but didn’t find much. Instead of wasting time looking for a perfect solution I created 18 variables in my script. 9 for each spike and 9 Transform components for the spike to stop at. Then I just call a series of Coroutines with an increasing delay which creates a wave of spikes coming up from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;voice-chat-recap&quot;&gt;Voice Chat Recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our voicechat on Friday, Gino said that we need more boss attacks. We espeically need more basic attacks that might not have 3 different phases. For one reason or another, our pod hasn’t been able to churn out the number of attacks that we expected to have at this point in Project Blue. So we discussed abandoning the necessity for all attacks to have 3 phases. We might have to abandon the 3 phases of a boss fight altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping-a-phase-from-a-previous-concept-2-hours-30-min&quot;&gt;Prototyping a Phase from a previous concept (2 Hours 30 Min)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodging a thrown projectile is a pretty basic attack. The Phase 1 of my Guardian prototype is exactly these concept of dodging a projectile. Gino said we needed attacks for the Guardian so I decided to prototype this phase design below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Guardian_Prototype_Phase1.png&quot; alt=&quot;phase1-guardian&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this prototype was only one phase there was a lot less programming and since I’m becoming more familiar with DOTween I was able to implement it faster. I spent some time looking at DOTween Eases and found this good graph that shows the movement speed graph of various easings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/easing-chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;easing-chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main time sink associated with this prototype was a bug I found in Robbert’s Boss Projectile script. The script has a method of assigning stages to the projectile. I wanted the projectile in this script to be two stages. In the first stage I wanted the sword to spin for a second ro two after it spawns. Then in the second stage I wanted it to fly at the player’s position. The bug is after you finish editing the values on the Boss Projectile script, it recompiles and sets NumStages back to one, forgetting the details of the second stage. At first I thought it was something wrong with how I was instantiating the object or editing the prefab, but after communicating with Robert about this scripts behavior we determined it was a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the prototype gif:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;podstudio-meeting-recap&quot;&gt;Pod/Studio Meeting Recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of a variety of reasons, we’re cutting out the Crystal Caves boss. I had created 2 prototypes for this boss, but I think that work can be salvaged by repurposing those attacks for the Guardian boss instead. I feel really bad for the artists time spent creating boss sprites and animations because they’re work can’t be salvaged like mine. We talked about how this is a really unfortunate thing that can happen in the industry when working on video games. Sometimes unexpected things will arise the hinder the outcome of your project. Fortunately, our project was set up in a way for us to re-scope. Nico talked about how having a finished AND polished game on your portfolio is better than a finished game. If we had kept the Crystal Caves boss, there was no guarentee that the game would have been polished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Wednesday we need to have a list of all the attacks we expect to have on the Guardian boss so that they can be programmed and tested. We discussed that while having Unity prototypes are very useful for fully visualizing the attack, they aren’t completely necessary to program the attacks into scriptable objects. Having designs with a written description is enough to program the attacks so that is what I decided to focus on next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-more-simple-designs-4-hours-30-min&quot;&gt;Creating More Simple Designs (4 Hours 30 Min)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only have 3 attacks total (ones that I made). I think I am the only designer that took the Studio for credit which might be a reason why we only have 3 designs. My goal for thsi set of designs was to come up with a bunch of simple attacks. Once we have a lot of attacks, later this week when we have a designer meeting we can choose which attacks to use instead of being forced to use what we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;falling-rubble&quot;&gt;Falling Rubble&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/falling-rubble.png&quot; alt=&quot;falling-rubble&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boss summons rubble from the environment to fall down on the player. In this design I drew them falling in a wave, they could fall in a random pattern as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiple-sideways-swords&quot;&gt;Multiple Sideways Swords&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/multiple-sideways-sword.png&quot; alt=&quot;multiple-sideways-sword&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attack is kind of similar to my Guardian prototype. Multiple copies of the Guardian’s sword spawn, rotate, and then fly at the player. Again, in the design they fly in a wave, but they could be random instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;falling-platforms-with-spikes&quot;&gt;Falling Platforms with Spikes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/falling-platforms-spikes.png&quot; alt=&quot;falling-platforms-spikes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian creates falling platforms that the player must hop on to avoid summoned spikes at the bottom of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shield-rush&quot;&gt;Shield Rush&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/shield-rush.png&quot; alt=&quot;shield-rush&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guardian uses magic/energy to create a “shield” in front of it and charges towards the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flying-shield-rush&quot;&gt;Flying Shield Rush&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/flying-shield-rush.png&quot; alt=&quot;flying-shield-rush&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very similar concept to the last attack. However, in this version the Guardian jumps up in the air first before rushing towards the player’s position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sword-beam&quot;&gt;Sword Beam&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/sword-beam.png&quot; alt=&quot;sword-beam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the ground, the Guardian spins it’s sword in front of itself very fast. A beam then shoots out of the center and is fired at the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My computer was acting really weird while I was drawing these sketches. First, my drawing tablet was raising a error about 75% of the time I tried using the “CTRL + Z” macro on my tablet. I had no idea what the error was saying since it was in mandarin. Along with this, every time I tried to press “CTRL + S” to save, my Windows would bring up the accessability window and ask me if I wanted to turn on speech assistance. Krita started sucking up most of my CPU so all of my other programs became unresponsive. For a few minutes I thought Krita crashed before I was able to save my designs. Luckily I was able to save once it became responsive again. I figured a restart was required because something obviously was wrong. When trying to pin my chrome tabs, they would close instead. I have no idea what went wrong and my drawing tablet was still being unresponsive at times. However, another reset of Krita seemed to solve things. I’m not sure if the problem is Krita, my drawing tablet, or Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playtesting-latest-build-30-min&quot;&gt;Playtesting Latest Build (30 Min)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time playtesting teh latest build of the game. This was done before I designed the 6 designs above. I wanted to refresh myself in all the ways Io could move and dodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confluence-pages-30-min&quot;&gt;Confluence Pages (30 Min)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created some Confluence pages to keep my completed work organized and in one place. Also to create a better way to share the work I’ve done with my pod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sprint I was tasked with implementing prototypes of my boss attack designs in Unity using DOTween, a Unity package. At the beginning of the sprint I was waiting for the boss projectile system to get finished so I spent some time looking into DOTween, BitBucket, and managing branches in a large project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reviewing-dotween-documentation-3-hours&quot;&gt;Reviewing DOTween Documentation (3 Hours)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOTween is a Unity package that I have not worked with before. In my opinion it appears advertised as an animation package, but apparently it can be used to create quick prototypes of boss attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started at the Confluence page Gino made about DOTween. It gave very general concepts about what the package is and what it does. He linked the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotween.demigiant.com/documentation.php&quot;&gt;Official DOTween documentation&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the Confluence page. I spent time looking at the different built in functions in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still a little confused so I looked up some YouTube videos that gave examples of how to use DOTween.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLFQp0TvsK0&quot;&gt;Easy Movement Queueing, Paths, and Tweening in Unity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRXm3UscUJM&amp;amp;t=3s&quot;&gt;Unity + DoTween&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-gitbitbucket-3-hours&quot;&gt;Working with Git/BitBucket (3 Hours)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like Seyhyun, I am not a big fan of git and really didn’t use it before this semester. We’re using BitBucket to handle our repository and branches. Max created a “Git Guidelines” Confluence page. I spent some time looking through this and familiarizing myself with how BitBucket works and how the Project_Blue repository is meant to be organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered an issue with BitBucket when creating a new branch. I followed the Confluence page instructions, but for some reason my branch was not showing up in my shell client when typing “git branch”. It did show up when running “git branch -a”, but I was not able to checkout the branch for some reason, the command would not run. I tried deleting the branch and recreating it, but that didn’t solve the issue. I found that using the GitHub for Desktop GUI application allowed me to switch to my branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When launching the project in Unity, I thought I had some errors with my branch, but after reading through some Discord messages from Max I realized I could ignore the errors I was getting (Wwise errors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I reviewed how assets should be stored/organized in the Unity Project. I was initally confused about the purpose of the “_Development” folder. I didn’t know if I should place my DOTween prototype scripts in this “_Development” folder or not. Later I found out that these prototype scripts won’t be in the final project build so they should be placed in “_Development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reviewing-boss-pod-tools-2-hours&quot;&gt;Reviewing Boss Pod Tools (2 Hours)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Boss pod have created tools that will make it easier to me to implement my attack prototypes. Robert Keller implemented a detailed script that handles Boss Projectiles. Since both of my prototypes utilize projectiles, I needed to learn how this script works. Robert included many properties in his script such as multiple stages, different methods of projectile destruction, stage transitions, movement settings, etc so this took some time to look through and figure out what settings would effect my prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue I found/ran into was instantiating projectiles. Gino set up a template prototype scene as a guide on how to build these prototypes. The projectile in his scene was not functioning correctly. It was meant to be set active in the Start() function and then instantiated/move towards the player after the boss jumps from one end of the template scene to the other. What was actually happening was it would instantiate after the boss moves and wouldn’t move toward the player. A weird fix to these was to set the projectile game object as inactive in the scene heirarchy. I’m not sure how this fixed the issue, but I was now able to instantiate projectiles in my prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crystal-slam-attack-scripts-8-hours&quot;&gt;Crystal Slam Attack Scripts (8 Hours)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with the DOTween package was tricky even after spending time looking through the documentation. A lot fo time was spent minorly agjusting float values and Game Object destinations until I achieved an attack prototype that looked good enough to share with the studio team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making minor adjustments to variable after writing the scripts did annoy me that much. What ending up being a large issue was this delay that was being inserted into my DOTween sequence. My scripts are written to call a coroutine in the Start() function of the script. This coroutine calls my function that runs my DOTween sequence after a minor delay (never more than 2 seconds). However, my DOTween actions weren’t actually executing until 20-30 seconds AFTER the code was seen. I proved this by writing a Debug.Log statement after my DOTween appends. This issue occured over all 3 of my scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought this up with Gino and we spent some time looking at my Attack Phase scripts. Nothing was fundamentally different from my code than DOTween code he has written in the past. This is a persisting issue and I hope I can figure it out when implementing my next prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My one regret in this prototype was not making the arms flap on the blocky bird boss. I initially thought that this would have been impossible because you cannot Tween the position of a Game Object in 2 actions happening at the same time, but I realized afterwards that I could have rotated the arm Game Objects with a different DOTween action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially when I shared my Phase 3 of this attack I got some feedback that it might not be extreme enough. I took that feedback and make version 2 of Phase 3 by adding moy projectiles for Io to dodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feb 23rd, 2020 - 2 Hours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not have an end of spring meeting because of spring break conflicting with our normal meeting times. We plan to have a makeup meeting as soon as possible after break. My hours this week were about 4 hours short. Next sprint I will do a better job of taking on more tasks and making sure I devote enough time to Project Blue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Blake</name></author><summary type="html">Pre-Alpha Final Sprint Post</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First Blog</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/WSoft-Dev-Blog/2020/02/17/First-Blog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Blog" /><published>2020-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/WSoft-Dev-Blog/2020/02/17/First-Blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/WSoft-Dev-Blog/2020/02/17/First-Blog.html">&lt;p&gt;Pre-Alpha 1 Sprint Post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has now been 2 weeks since Project Blue officially kicked off. I have been placed in the Bosses pod as part of the Design and Programming teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Jira task for this sprint was to design potential boss attacks that could work for either the Crystal Caves boss (Bird) or the Abandoned City boss (Guardian).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-design&quot;&gt;Pre-Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before thinking of the attacks I did a little bit of prep that would help me think of better attacks. Gino linked some videos related to designing boss battles on Confluence that I watched. I also watched some videos on my own of exciting boss battles. Another source of inspiration I had was to think of different Shonen Animes I’ve watched such as My Hero Academia and Attack of Titan. These shows have been interesting and hyped fight sequences that could work in a boss battle.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-concepts&quot;&gt;Initial Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the first two concepts I came up with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Boss_Attack_Sketch3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ground Slam&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Boss_Attack_Sketch2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Spinning Projectile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best way to summarize my attack prototypes… ENVIRONMENT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea of the boss using the environment to help defeat the enemy. In my opinion, when bosses in video games do this it creates a feeling that the boss belongs in that area/level. I also tried to keep the players ability into account to make it feel like the player was adequately equipped to fight this boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first image the boss punches/slams the ground. As a result of this action, crystals/debris flies up from the ground. My main inspiration for this attack was from a few episodes of (no spoilers) My Hero Academia. I won’t go into more specifics than that, but if you know then you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is probably my favorite design of the two (which you can probably tell from increased quality). The player, who attacks in melee range, would use their teleport ability to escape the damaging environment the boss creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second image attack is a projectile orriented attack. The boss summons/levitates a single object that is launched quickly at the players position. My inspiration for this attack was the Enchanted Sword enemy from Terraria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/terraria_sword.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Terraria Sword&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enemy in Terraria finds you underground, spins around for a seconds, and then launches itself at the player. That’s how I’m envisioning the projectile would fly in this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concept-feedback&quot;&gt;Concept Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gino, the bosses pod lead, gave me some feedback about these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ground/Slam Attack&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Great example of an attack I could see being used for the Crystal Caves boss. Straightforward explanation as how it forces the player to move. I am curious how exactly how the hazards should come up from the ground through. Should it all come up at once? Or should it move outward from the boss, appearing like a wave of crystals? Also, will it continue movement from the floor to the walls, and possibly even the ceiling? Don’t worry about addressing these questions now though, as they can be answered after this attack is implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Projectile Targeted Attack&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I could see this attack being more characteristic of the Abandoned City boss. Still prototype this. Consider using DOLookAt() to aim the projectile towards the player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;failed-concept&quot;&gt;Failed Concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a third concept that I discovered wouldn’t be impactful after recieving feedback about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Boss_Attack_Sketch1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Failed Wall Concept&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attack features a wall of environment/crystals/debris/whatever that the boss summons or levitates. After a brief moment for the boss to get the environment objects in position, it launches them outwards towards the player. There will be gaps in the wall of objects that the player can teleport to in order to dodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wouldn’t work in its current state because as Gino pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wall Attack&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Does this assume the player cannot teleport through the boss’s attacks?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The player has an ability where they can throw their sword and teleport to it. They wouldn’t need to look for the gap in the current state of the attack because they could throw their sword through the projectile and teleport to it. This attack could still work, but it needs to be redesigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-feedback&quot;&gt;Using Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After speaking with Gino in person he reminded me of the 3 phases each boss will go through. The first phase introduces an attack, phase two will introduce a twist to the attack, and phase 3 will be a slightly amplified version of phase 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to my first two concepts and created the attack in all 3 phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design-iteration&quot;&gt;Design Iteration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;crystal-ground-slam&quot;&gt;Crystal Ground Slam&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Crystal_Prototype_Phase1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crystal 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1: An addition. The boss does a little bit of light flapping. While flapping its wings, it shoots crystals out from its wings. The boss lands lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Crystal_Prototype_Phase2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crystal 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Same core concept as before. In this phase the boss lands heavily instead of lightly after shooting projectiles from its wings. This heavy slam “breaks the ground” and sends out a wave of crystals from the ground. The crystals quickly degrade and break without additional effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Crystal_Prototype_Phase3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crystal 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 3: A slight addition. After the actions of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portion of this attack, the boss raises its wings and breaks off pieces of the crystals that came from the ground at the player, creating additional projectiles for the player to dodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;guardian-weapon-proficiency&quot;&gt;Guardian Weapon Proficiency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Guardian_Prototype_Phase1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Guardian 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 1: The same mechanic from the original concept. The Guardian summons a phantom sword object that will teleport blink to the player very similar to the player’s core ability. Might make the sword reappear right before hitting the player to give the player the chance to dodge when first encountering the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Guardian_Prototype_Phase2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Guardian 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 2: Where things get very interesting. Using its second bracelet, the Guardian summons a clone of itself and hovers above the player, demonstrating its mastery of the bracelet/weapon. After hovering for a second or two, they teleport and strike the player. I think it would be smart to give the player a chance to parry this attack rather than simply dodging, but if Io parries the clone she will take damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/WSoft-Dev-Blog/images/Guardian_Prototype_Phase3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Guardian 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase 3: Combines Phase 1 and 2 essentially. The swords will strike first and then the Guardian + clone. The projectiles are staggered making it require a sequence of skilled dodging from the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-sprint-plans&quot;&gt;Next Sprint Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am awaiting approval from Gino on my iterated designs. Once approved I will be working on implementing them in Unity as Scriptable Objects.&lt;/p&gt;
